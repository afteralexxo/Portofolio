          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>My name is Alemayehu Mekonen. I am a skilled and experienced web
             developer from Ethiopia. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
              I am a deep understanding of programming concepts and an ability to
               apply them to my work as a web developer.
               I am well-versed in various web development technologies, including REACT
               , NODEJS, MONGODB, and more, which enables me to create and maintain websites
                and web-based applications with ease. I understands that user experience is
                 key, and I puts a lot of effort into making sure that the websites 
                 I develops are easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provide
             a seamless experience for the user. Whether it's a simple brochure
              website or a complex web application, My goal is to create something 
              that is not only functional but also intuitive and easy to use.

                  , but I'm so excited to have acquired knowledge in these important technologies.
